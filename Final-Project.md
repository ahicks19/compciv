For my project, I started by looking at 100 years of data on snowfall levels in Tahoe City, California. My biggest struggle was how to find a more readable format of the data, as opposed to the 100+ separate charts that the NOAA provided me.
As you suggested, I did a lot more manual research to help me in this area. I eventually found deep in the Internet a paper someone had written that referenced the NOAA Tahoe City data. I went into her citations and found a link that took me to a spreadsheet that had ever year of Tahoe City's snowfall data on one chart.
I found that if I curled the URL using different dataset IDs (when you and I tried this originally we were using location IDs and station IDs, which for whatever reason didn't churn out the same results), I could get data from essentially any city in the United States (well, any city that has snow and a weather station).
Once again I was faced with a manual research problem. Much like Twitter analysis (for example, when we did the positive statements about Hitler versus negative), my data needed more context. 
Yes, this churned out data for every station station in America. However, there were massive holes in certain data sets (for example, some would be missing 10, 15, 20 year chunks, or would have "data" that was simply a blank chart with a label). 
So, I had to actually look at the data and decide what my boundaries were going to be. I wanted at least a 50 year dataset, which narrowed it down to fewer than 30 stations. Then I needed all 50 years to be complete, which narrowed it to fewer than 15. Then I needed stations across multiple areas of the country with large ski resorts because I actually wanted to do a comparison study that meant something, as opposed to just meaningless charts, which narrowed it down to six.
So, I ended with data from Tahoe City, California; Steamboat Springs, Colarado; Jackson, Wyoming; Iron Mountain, Michigan; Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina; and Mohonk Lake, New York.

While the changes don't necessarily look dramatic, it is clear that snowfall has been affected over time (most likely by climate change).
For all five cities, their highest highs have slowly decreased over the past 50 years. Each has peaks and valleys, of course, but the peaks are nowhere near where they used to be.
One of the more interesting things to notice, however, are the similarities between Tahoe City and Grandfather Mountain. While Colorado, Wyoming, Michigan, and New York all experienced spikes in snowfall over the last three years, both California and North Carolina saw massive drops.
After further research, I discovered that while it was quite as severe in California, North Carolina has actually been in a state of drought. On the other hand, Colorado, Michigan, and New York have been experiencing record low winter temperatures.
While certain Republican officials might claim that this negates global warming ("but it can't be global warming...it's colder in New York!"), these are actually proof of climate change. Climate (global warming) affects weather (snowfall outside right now). When the climate changes, the weather changes. Global warming can cause both warm and cold spells, which obviously can and will affect snowfall. So if you want to go skiing, head to one of the cold states. It just might be too cold for you to go outside.

I've put the links to the five charts below. I put the JavaScript and HTML scripts for them in separate folders.
